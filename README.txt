Apprenticeship Project:

For my end of course synoptic project for my Software Developer Technician Apprenticeship I was tasked with working for a fictional software development company, WeDevelopNow, to create two new webpages for an already existing  apprenticeship company. The website reference to me was: https://www.apprenticetips.com/

I was tasked with working within the User Interface design that was already set and had only a couple of different colours I was allowed to use for my project. The design followed the same principle as the original website, the main difference being that I had to place the development company's logo in the header alongside the normal header. I was also provided a database to use.

The first page was a submission form for declaration of interest in the apprenticeship services for Apprentice Tips main website and this was named Expression of Interest.

The final page I had to develop was a searching tool to help users navigate different apprenticeticeships based on different search criterion inputted by the user and was named Apprenticeship Search.
